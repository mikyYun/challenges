# MongoDB
https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb

MongoDB is a document database with scalabilty and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.
```
* Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents => fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time
* Maps to the objects in your application code => making data easy to work with
* Ad hoc queries, indexing and real time aggregation => provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data
* Distributed database at its core => high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use
* Free to use.
```

* MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program
```
  NoSQL?
  is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases.
  No SQL databases are quite useful for working with `large sets` of distributed data
  MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information
```

## WHY MongoDB?
1. Flexibility
2. Flexible Query Model
3. Native Aggregation
4. Schema-less model

## Characteristics of MongoDB
1. General Purpose database
2. Flexible schema design
3. Scalability and Load balancing
4. Aggregation framework
5. Native replication
6. Security features
7. JSON
8. MapReduce

## MongoDB CRUS
1. find()
2. insert()
3. update()
4. delete()

## Pros and Cons
https://www.thinkautomation.com/our-two-cents/understanding-the-key-mongodb-pros-and-cons/

* Pros
1. high speed/performance
2. support ad-hoc queries
3. flexible
4. sharding
5. access to technical support
6. integrates with ThinkAutomation

* Cons: MongoDB might not be the best fit for every organisation or project a few reasons
1. Joins are awkward : doesn't support joins
2. High reliance on good indexs
3. Duplilcate data is a common problem
4. High memory usage
5. Limited data size and limited nesting


## Mongoose
Mongoose is an ODM or Object Document Mapper.
It is built on top of the MongoDB driver for MongoDB and Node.js

Mongoose allows users to conveniently create and manage data in MongoDB. While it is possible to manage data, define schemas using MongoDB APIs, it is quite difficult to do so.
