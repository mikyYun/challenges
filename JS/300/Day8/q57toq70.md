var a = 1;
var z = a;
// and
var a, z = a = 1;
// Answer = True
/**Declare variable
 * var a, z
 * assign values
 * z = a
 * a = 1
 * z = a = 1
*/
```
* q58
Use a reducer to find the min value of the below array
```js
// q
const arr = [5, 10, 12, 4, 2];
// my answer
const minValue = arr.reduce((prevVal, currentVal) => {
  if (prevVal > currentVal) return currentVal;
  return prevVal;
});
```
* q59

```js
  const a = { x : 1 };
  const b = {...a};
  const c = {};
  Object.assign(c, a);
  a.x = 2;
  console.log(a.x); // 2
  console.log(b.x); // 1
  console.log(c.x); // 1
  
  // result: 2, 1, 1
```
* q64
Implement the classic example of a closure that increments up each time it is called.
```js
  let increment = (() => {
    let count = 0;
    return () => {
      count += 1;
      return count
    }
  })();

  increment() // 1;
  increment() // 2;
  increment() // 3;
  increment() // 4;
```

  };
  // arguments: [x, y && y, callee: f, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): f]

   * 
A)  prevents new properties from being added.. t
B)  prevents existing properties from being removed.. t
C)  prevents changing the enumerability of properties.. t
D)  prevents changing the configurability of properties,, t
E)  prevents changing the writability of properties.. t
