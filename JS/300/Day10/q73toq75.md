## **Questions**
* q73
What is a race condition ?<br />
A race condition is when two threads or async processes must complete in the proper order and update some shared state, otherwise there will be a bug or unwated outcome.<br />
=> Happens because of the orders of requests and responses are not always eqal
```js
  fetchFunctionA();
  fetchFunctionB();
  // can't garentee the fetchFunctionA will be completed faster than fetchFunctionB 
```

## Use AbortController API
* AbortController has two main property
1. AbortController.signal => property for read only. used for cancel requests
2. AbortController.abort() => A method that can be canceled before a request linked with a signal is completed

```js
  const controller = new AbortController();
  // fetchA
  fetch(url, {
    signal: controller.signal,
  });

  // call abort any point to cancel
  controller.abort();
```

## Summary
To improve UX, using AbortController is not a perfect way. Remove, reduce redundant events using **Debounce**,and  **Throttle**. And handle race conditions using AbortController.
